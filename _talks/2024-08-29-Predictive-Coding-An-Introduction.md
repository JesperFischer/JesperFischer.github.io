After over a year of collaboration with Julian Reichert and Jonas Tesarz, we had finally designed and conducted a large sample size of healthy controls and fibromyalgia patients. 
With the end of data-collection i was invited to Heidelberg to give a talk about predictive coding and a workshop on using probabilistic programming languages such as Stan. 

This talk was given to the Clinic for General Internal Medicine and Psychosomatics in Heidelberg.
