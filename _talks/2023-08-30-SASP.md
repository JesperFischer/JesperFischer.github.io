After a successful abstract submission, I got announced as one of the three three Poster Prize Winners acclaimed for an outstanding scientific contribution to SASP 2022.

This meant i was invited to give an oral presentation at my first scientific conference for a prize of 750â‚¬.

I presented what had been my bachelor thesis, which investigated learning, thermosensation and the Thermal Grill Illusion which produces painful percepts from innocous stimulation.

The published paper (pre-print for now) can be found [here](https://JesperFischer.github.io/files/Uncertainty-in-Thermosensory-Expectations.pdf).
