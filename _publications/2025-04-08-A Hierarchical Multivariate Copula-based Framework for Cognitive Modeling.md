Most studies of perceptual illusions rely on explicit reports alone, offering a limited view into
the computations that underlie ambiguous sensory experiences. Here, we introduce a multivariate computational approach to model paradoxical heat sensation (PHS), a thermosensory
illusion in which skin cooling evokes sensations of warmth, as an individual-specific process.
We tested 75 healthy adults (aged 21–80) using a perceptual decision-making task with
stimuli designed to elicit PHS. Binary perceptual choices, response times and confidence ratings were jointly analysed using hierarchical multivariate Bayesian modelling to characterise
PHS at both the population and individual levels across the lifespan. We tested two distinct
perceptual profiles: “true perceivers”, who experience PHS similarly to a veridical warm percept; and “unsure perceivers”, who perceive PHS as an ambiguous experience. At the group
level, behaviour was best explained by the unsure perceiver model, suggesting that PHS is
often an uncertain experience, rather than a categorical misperception. At the individual
level, however, both profiles were represented, with considerable inter-individual variability
in model fit. Older participants were more likely to report PHS and did so at lower levels of
thermal contrast, but we observed no correlation between age and perceptual profile. This
suggests that while ageing increases the likelihood of experiencing PHS, it does not alter the
qualitative nature of its perception. These findings also show how multivariate modelling
of perceptual, decisional and metacognitive responses can reveal distinct, subjective profiles
and their variation across individuals and age.
