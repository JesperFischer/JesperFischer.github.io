I am a Research assistant with a masters degree in cognitive science from Aarhus, Denmark where I am also currently working. 
I work in the [body-pain-perception lab](https://github.com/Body-Pain-Perception-Lab), where we mainly study thermosensation and pain. 
Here I have been working on various projects and [publications](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?user=bRDEyH8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), 
with my main focus has been on how expectations can shape veridical thermosensation and the Thermal Grill Illusion. 
The Thermal Grill illusion being a burning or painful precept elicited by innocuous interleaved warm and cold stimuli.

Computational modeling and statistics 
======

Through my education in cognitive science I have gained a wide set of skills in statistics and computational modeling. 
These skills include but are not limited to

1. Building new computational models (in hierarchical frameworks).
1. Testing existing computational and statistical models.


Current projects and interests 
======

For quite a while [(including large parts of my Master thesis)](../files/Master-thesis.pdf) I have been interested in how we can build models that leverage all the information that is contained within an experiment.
This entails building multivariate models such that all data from the experiment can be analyzed simultaneously without loss of information.
While the ongoing process of building a framework for such models, I do also strive to make this framework as robust as possible. 
I have seen too many implementations of models that when properly tested do not work as intended. 
This means that i spend many hours testing my models and frameworks, through the Bayesian workflow. 
Many of the ideas and pratices of the Bayesian workflow and how they can be implemented can be found in my [Blog posts](https://jesperfischer.github.io/year-archive/).
