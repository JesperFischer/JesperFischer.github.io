I am a research assistant with a master’s degree in Cognitive Science from Aarhus University in Denmark, where I am also currently based.
I work in the [body-pain-perception lab](https://github.com/Body-Pain-Perception-Lab), focusing on thermosensation and pain. 
My research primarily explores how expectations influence veridical thermosensation and phenomena such as the Thermal Grill Illusion.
The Thermal Grill Illusion refers to the perception of burning or painful sensations caused by innocuous interleaved warm and cold stimuli.

  
Computational modeling and statistics 
======

Through my education in cognitive science I have developed a diverse set of skills in statistics and computational modeling. These skills span 
from using and understanding complex statistical models, critically evaluating them and making inference from them. In the past years my expertise
has also moved to developing new computational models within hierarchical Bayesian frameworks, herein familiarizing myself with the general 
[Bayesian workflow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01808). I have come to enjoy  both the technical side of cognitive science in using proper statistical
methods, maximizing statistical power or minimizing false positive rates, but also how these technical skills can interact with theoretical knowledge
to test meaningful hypotheses.


Current projects and interests 
======

For some time now, spanning significant portions of my [Master thesis](../files/Master-thesis.pdf), I have been exploring how to build models
that fully leverage all the information contained within an experiment. This involved developing multivariate models that allow for 
simultaneous analysis of various response variables within the same theoretical framework, minimizing information loss in statistical inference.

While building a robust framework for these models is an ongoing process, I am committed to ensuring the reliability of my implementations. 
This reliability and rigor is also reflected in the [Bayesian-Workflow blogposts](https://jesperfischer.github.io/year-archive/).
