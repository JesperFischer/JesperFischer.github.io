I am a research assistant with a masterâ€™s degree in Cognitive Science from Aarhus University in Denmark, where I am also currently based.
I work in the [body-pain-perception lab](https://github.com/Body-Pain-Perception-Lab), focusing on thermosensation and pain. 
My research primarily explores how expectations influence veridical thermosensation and phenomena such as the Thermal Grill Illusion.
The Thermal Grill Illusion refers to the perception of burning or painful sensations caused by innocuous interleaved warm and cold stimuli.
I have been contributibng to  various projects and [publications](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?user=bRDEyH8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), 

  
Computational modeling and statistics 
======

Through my education in cognitive science I have developed a diverse skill set in statistics and computational modeling. 

1. Developing new computational models within hierarchical frameworks.

1. Evaluating and testing existing computational and statistical models.



Current projects and interests 
======

For some time now, spanning significant portions of my [Master thesis](../files/Master-thesis.pdf), I have been exploring how to build models that fully leverage all the information contained within an experiment.
This involves developing multivariate models that allow for simultaneous analysis of all experimental data, minimizing information loss.


While building a robust framework for these models is an ongoing process, I am committed to ensuring the reliability of my implementations. This reliability and rigor is also reflected in the [Bayesian-Workflow blogposts](https://jesperfischer.github.io/year-archive/).
