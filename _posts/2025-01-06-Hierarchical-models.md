## Overview

Hierarchical models is probably the term with the most diverse number of
names in the litterature; Mixed / random effects, multilevel and
hierarchical models just to name a few.

In the simplest term these types of model allows one to model data that
has inherent structure. Here we will mainly focus on having several
subjects completing the same experiment.

This essentially means we want to build a model that can account for the
fact that we have different individuals completing the same task. So
instead of having to model these individuals separately we build a model
that models all the individuals together. We do this by assuming they
are from a similar underlying distribution (population?).

These types of models thus allows to estimate individual level
parameters for each subject, but also group level statistics, which is
something you do not get for free without hierarchical models. These
group level statistics are what is usually of interest in many tasks as
we want to see differences between groups based on some experimentally
manipulated variable.

The concept of hierarchical models are quite simple and are best
illustrated by a figure stolen from
[here](https://bookdown.org/MathiasHarrer/Doing_Meta_Analysis_in_R/multilevel-ma.html)

Here the uppermost distribution represents the group level distribution
for a parameter, and the individual smaller distributions below
![\theta](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctheta "\theta") are
the subject level distributions of the parameter.

What we will normally assume is that our group level parameters are
normally distributed and then we draw subject level parameters from this
group level distribution.

Before demonstrating this through our Bayesian workflow, where we write
our models in stan we might start with the more familiar lmer syntax.
Here we’ll look at a hierarchical linear (mixed) effects model with the
following lmer syntax: y ~ x + (x \| id). Which spelled out means we
model y as a function of x for where each subject get their own slope
and intercept (e.g. (x \| id) syntax).

We will also look at the uncertainty of this linear model i.e. sigma
later, but for now we keep it fixed for all subjects as this is what is
assumed by the usual lmer model.

## Simulations:

We start with simulating some parameter values for our agents and then
plot them:

``` r
#number of simulated subjects
n_sub = 20
#number of simulated trials
n_trials = 100

#intercepts:
int = rnorm(n_sub,0,50)
#slopes:
slopes = rnorm(n_sub,3,3)
#sigma
sigma = 50

#x values
xs = seq(0,50,length.out = n_trials)

# simulate trialwise responses:
df = data.frame(intercept = int, slopes = slopes,sigma = sigma) %>% 
  mutate(id = 1:n_sub,
         x = list(seq(0,50,length.out = n_trials))) %>% 
  unnest(x) %>% rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(y_mean = intercept + x * slopes,
         y_pred = rnorm(1,intercept + x * slopes, sigma))
```

plotting these without sigma (e.g. one line per subject):

``` r
df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y_mean,group = id))+
  geom_line()+
  theme_minimal()
```

![](../images/Bayesian-Workflow-Tutorials/2025-01-06-Hierarchical-models_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

Individual data points for each subject.

``` r
df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y_pred,group = id))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~id)+
  theme_minimal()
```

![](../images/Bayesian-Workflow-Tutorials/2025-01-06-Hierarchical-models_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

and lastly the group level (aggregating over subjects):

``` r
df %>% 
  group_by(x) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(y_pred), se = sd(y_pred)/sqrt(n())) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = mean))+
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = mean-2*se,ymax = mean+2*se))+
  theme_minimal()
```

![](../images/Bayesian-Workflow-Tutorials/2025-01-06-Hierarchical-models_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

Please note that one could fit these subjects individually and then
combine their parameters estimates to gain a group level estimate. In
code this would amount to looping through each subject with an
individual level model and then collecting their parameter estimates.
Inorder to then acheive a group level estimate for the parameters one
would use error-proporgation, for instance bootstrapping to get a group
level mean and standard deviation of each parameter estimate.

We here start by showing this apporach to compare it to the full
hierarchical model. Taking the stancode from the model fitting markdown
we have:

Note, here we also add some vague priors to help the sampler:

``` stan
//This block defines the input that. So these things needs to go into the model
data {
  //Define the number of datapoints this is defined by an integer
  int N;
  //Define a vector called y that is as long as the number of datapoints (i.e. N)
  vector[N] y;
  // same as y but a variable called x our independent variable
  vector[N] x;
}

// This is the parameters block. 
// Here we define the free parameters which are the onces that STAN estimates for us.
// this is again a,b and sigma
parameters {
  real a;
  real b;
  real sigma;
}

// This is the model block here we define the model.

model {
  //priors
  a ~ normal(0,500);
  b ~ normal(0,10);
  sigma ~ normal(0,5);
  
  y ~ normal(a+b*x, exp(sigma));
}
```

Now we loop though each of our subjects and collect the summary of their
parameters:

``` r
#initalize an empty dataframe to collect all the information
parameters = data.frame()
for(sub in unique(df$id)){

  #subset the data
  df1 = df %>% filter(id == sub)
  
  # fit the model to the subsetted data
  fit = model_obj2$sample(data = list(N = nrow(df1), x = df1$x, y = df1$y_pred),
                          seed = seeds,
                          refresh = 0)
  
  # collect parameters
  param_sum = fit$summary(c("a","b","sigma"))
  
  # collect diagnoistics
  diag= data.frame(fit$diagnostic_summary())
  
  #collect all the information in one dataframe
  param_sum = param_sum %>% 
    mutate(id = sub,
           div = mean(diag$num_divergent),
           tree = mean(diag$num_max_treedepth),
           energy = mean(diag$ebfmi),
  )
  
  #combine it all
  parameters = rbind(parameters,param_sum)
}
```

## Checking model diagnoistics

``` r
parameters %>% select(rhat,ess_bulk,ess_tail,div,tree,energy) %>% 
  pivot_longer(everything()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = value))+geom_histogram(col = "black")+
  facet_wrap(~name, scales = "free")
```

    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

![](../images/Bayesian-Workflow-Tutorials/2025-01-06-Hierarchical-models_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

No divergences, no tree depth, Rhat values close to 1 and effective
sample sizes (ess\_\*) very high; looks good!

Now we can look how well each fit, fits the individual data points here
firstly just the mean predictions and their 95% credibility interval:

``` r
# wrangle the parameters dataframe to get the mean and 95% Credibility interval:

params = parameters %>% select(mean,q5,q95,variable,id) %>% 
  pivot_wider(values_from = c("mean","q5","q95"), names_from = variable) %>%
  mutate(x = list(seq(0,50,length.out = n_trials))) %>% 
  unnest(x) %>% rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(y_mean = mean_a + mean_b * x,
         y_q5 = q5_a + q5_b * x,
         y_q95 = q95_a + q95_b * x)


df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y_pred,group = id))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_line(data = params, aes(x = x, y = y_mean), col = "red")+
  geom_ribbon(data = params, aes(x = x, y = y_mean, ymin = y_q5, ymax = y_q95), fill = "red", alpha = 0.75)+
  facet_wrap(~id)+
  theme_minimal()
```

![](../images/Bayesian-Workflow-Tutorials/2025-01-06-Hierarchical-models_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- -->

This looks really good! Now we can also check the group level if we
propagate the uncertainty from each individual. This is essentially
wrong as we assume that all the parameters follow a normal distribution
which is not necessarily the case!

``` r
params = parameters %>% 
  select(mean,sd,variable,id) %>% 
  mutate(replicate = list(1:100)) %>% 
  unnest() %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(draw = rnorm(n(),mean,sd)) %>% 
  group_by(replicate,variable) %>% 
  summarize(draw = mean(draw)) %>% 
  select(draw,variable,replicate) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "variable",values_from = "draw") %>% 
  unnest() %>% 
  mutate(x = list(seq(0,50,length.out = n_trials))) %>% 
  unnest(x) %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(y_mean = a + b * x,
         y_low = a + b * x - 2 * exp(sigma),
         y_high = a + b * x + 2 * exp(sigma))
```

    ## Warning: `cols` is now required when using `unnest()`.
    ## ℹ Please use `cols = c(replicate)`.

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'replicate'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

    ## Warning: `cols` is now required when using `unnest()`.
    ## ℹ Please use `cols = c()`.

``` r
df %>% group_by(x) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(y_pred), se = sd(y_pred)/sqrt(n())) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = mean))+
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = mean-2*se,ymax = mean+2*se))+
    geom_line(data = params, aes(x = x, y = y_mean, group = replicate), col = "red", alpha = 0.1)+
  theme_minimal()
```

![](../images/Bayesian-Workflow-Tutorials/2025-01-06-Hierarchical-models_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)<!-- -->

And with the prediction intervals:

``` r
df %>% group_by(x) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(y_pred), se = sd(y_pred)/sqrt(n())) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = mean))+
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = mean-2*se,ymax = mean+2*se))+
    geom_line(data = params, aes(x = x, y = y_mean, group = replicate), col = "red", alpha = 0.1)+
  geom_ribbon(data = params, aes(x = x, y = y_mean, ymin = y_low, ymax = y_high),
              fill = "red", alpha = 0.1)+
  theme_minimal()
```

## Hierarchical Implementation

Now we build the Hierarchical model.

The main idea is that each of our free parameters for each subject is
drawn from the same group level distribution (first plot in this
markdown). In the case where we assume a normal distribution for the
group level we would have:

![a \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_a, \sigma_a)](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a%20%5Csim%20%5Cmathcal%7BN%7D%28%5Cmu_a%2C%20%5Csigma_a%29 "a \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_a, \sigma_a)")

![b \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_b, \sigma_b)](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?b%20%5Csim%20%5Cmathcal%7BN%7D%28%5Cmu_b%2C%20%5Csigma_b%29 "b \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_b, \sigma_b)")

![\sigma \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu\_\sigma, \sigma\_\sigma)](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma%20%5Csim%20%5Cmathcal%7BN%7D%28%5Cmu_%5Csigma%2C%20%5Csigma_%5Csigma%29 "\sigma \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_\sigma, \sigma_\sigma)")

This would thus entail that we just set priors on the group level
parameters and let the model do the rest: Before we code it up we need
to consider what goes into the model!

Firstly we need to provide stan with 2 additional arguments. The number
of subjects, but also a identifier for which subject this trial belongs
to.

``` stan
//This block defines the input that. So these things needs to go into the model
data {
  
  //Define the number of datapoints this is defined by an integer
  int N;
  
  //Define the number of subjects this is defined by an integer
  int S;
  
  //identifier for which subject this trial belongs to
  array[N] int  S_id;
  
  //Define a vector called y that is as long as the number of datapoints (i.e. N)
  vector[N] y;
  // same as y but a variable called x our independent variable
  vector[N] x;
}

// This is the parameters block. 
// Here we define the free parameters which are the onces that STAN estimates for us.
// this is again a,b and sigma
parameters {
  real mu_a;
  real sigma_a;
  
  vector[S] a;
  
  real mu_b;
  real sigma_b;
  
  vector[S] b;
  
  real mu_sigma;
  real sigma_sigma;  
  
  vector[S] sigma;
  
}

// This is the model block here we define the model.

model {
  //priors
  mu_a ~ normal(0,10);
  sigma_a ~ normal(0,5);
  
  a ~ normal(mu_a,exp(sigma_a));
  
  mu_b ~ normal(0,10);
  sigma_b ~ normal(0,5);
  
  b ~ normal(mu_b,exp(sigma_b));
  
  mu_sigma ~ normal(0,3);
  sigma_sigma ~ normal(0,3);
  
  sigma ~ normal(mu_sigma,exp(sigma_sigma));
  
  for(n in 1:N){
    
    y[n] ~ normal(a[S_id[n]]+b[S_id[n]]*x[n], exp(sigma[S_id[n]]));

  }  
}
```

There was alot of new stuff in this stan model. Lets go over it.

- We defined two extra data arguments, the number of subjects S and an
  identifier for each subject belongs to what trial S_id.

- We defined group and subject level parameters for each of the 3
  parameters of the model. The group level parameters are called mu\_\*
  and sigma\_\* and are the group level parameters. We also defined a
  subject level parameter for each subject with the “vector\[S\]
  …(parameter)” code.

- The subject level parameters are being sampled from a normal
  distribution with the group level means and standard deviations i.e. a
  ~ normal(mu_a,exp(sigma_a)).

- Lastly, the particular model is defined in the trial level loop where
  we loop through all the trials (trials for all subjects). In this loop
  we use the identifier for each subject i.e. \[S_id\[n\]\] to assign
  each of the parameters in the vector to the right subject.

``` r
# fit the model to the subsetted data
fit = model_obj2$sample(data = list(N = nrow(df),
                                    x = df$x,
                                    y = df$y_pred,
                                    S = length(unique(df$id)),
                                    S_id = df$id),
                        seed = seeds,

Oh that looks quite bad, quite some divergences.

lets look at the summary and the trace plots for the group level
parameters:

``` r
fit$summary(c("mu_a","sigma_a",
                       "mu_b","sigma_b",
                       "mu_sigma","sigma_sigma"))

Lets look at the traceplots.

``` r
mcmc_trace(fit$draws(c("mu_a","sigma_a",
                       "mu_b","sigma_b",
                       "mu_sigma","sigma_sigma")))
```

![](../images/Bayesian-Workflow-Tutorials/2025-01-06-Hierarchical-models_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png)<!-- -->

The traceplots and the summary statistics do show kind of the same
story. The sigma_sigma and mu_sigma parameters are quite badly
converged!

Now we’ll look at another diagnostic tool, the pair plots.

The is a plot with marginial histograms but also with pairwise
scatterplots of the parameters. Additionally this function takes the
information of the diagnoistics “np” and shows you which values got a
divergences!

For the intercept:

``` r
mcmc_pairs(fit$draws(c("mu_a","sigma_a","a[1]")),
           np = nuts_params(fit))
```

![](../images/Bayesian-Workflow-Tutorials/2025-01-06-Hierarchical-models_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png)<!-- -->

for the slope

``` r
mcmc_pairs(fit$draws(c("mu_b","sigma_b","b[1]")),
           np = nuts_params(fit))
```

![](../images/Bayesian-Workflow-Tutorials/2025-01-06-Hierarchical-models_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png)<!-- -->

for the standard deviation of the normal distribution

``` r
mcmc_pairs(fit$draws(c("mu_sigma","sigma[1]","sigma_sigma")),
           np = nuts_params(fit))
```

![](../images/Bayesian-Workflow-Tutorials/2025-01-06-Hierarchical-models_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png)<!-- -->

What one wants to see ideally in these plots is one big “blob” of points
for all the pairwise scatter plots and histograms that are somewhat
nicely normal. When we high the divergent transitions with red crosses
and we see a pattern in where they are, they can give us clues into what
the issue might be. The problem here is especially for the last plot of
sigma and between the indidvidual sigma parameters (sigma\[1\]) and the
standard deviations of the group level standard devivation
(sigma_sigma). The pairwise scatter plot between these two shows a
pattern where all the divergences are when sigma_sigma is low (below
-4). This means that the sampler encounters issues in excatly that
region and we thus need to help it!

This is probably the most common issue with hierarchical models. In more
severe cases this behaviour will look like a funnel see plot from this
[awesome
blog](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/hierarchical_modeling.html).


![](../images/Bayesian-Workflow-Tutorials/2025-01-06-Hierarchical-models_files/figure-gfm/funnel.PNG)<!-- -->

Fortunatly this problem has a quite easy solution, and has to do with
parameterization as mentioned in the diagnoistics markdown. The solution
is called non-centered parameterization.

Parameterization as mentioned refers to the way that the model is
structured. Essentially there is many different ways of writing the same
model, mathematically, and it turns our that some models are much easier
to make converge with a particular way of writing the model.

What we have to do here is we need to re-write how we get our subject
level parameters, instead of:

![a \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_a, \sigma_a)](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a%20%5Csim%20%5Cmathcal%7BN%7D%28%5Cmu_a%2C%20%5Csigma_a%29 "a \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_a, \sigma_a)")

we will write it as:

![a \sim \mu_a +\mathcal{N}(0,1) \cdot \sigma_a](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a%20%5Csim%20%5Cmu_a%20%2B%5Cmathcal%7BN%7D%280%2C1%29%20%5Ccdot%20%5Csigma_a "a \sim \mu_a +\mathcal{N}(0,1) \cdot \sigma_a")

which is mathematically equivalent.

What this essentially does, is that it makes us sample from a standard
normal distribution
![\mathcal{N}(0,1)](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmathcal%7BN%7D%280%2C1%29 "\mathcal{N}(0,1)")
which is going to be the subject level scaled difference between the
group mean and subject.

Please note that i introduced another block which we will be using in
later markdowns, the transformed parameters{…} block. Essentially this
does nothing for the sample, but makes extracting the subject level
parameters afterwards easier. We’ll get back to this block later on!

``` stan
//This block defines the input that. So these things needs to go into the model
data {
  
  //Define the number of datapoints this is defined by an integer
  int N;
  
  //Define the number of subjects this is defined by an integer
  int S;
  
  //identifier for which subject this trial belongs to
  array[N] int  S_id;
  
  //Define a vector called y that is as long as the number of datapoints (i.e. N)
  vector[N] y;
  // same as y but a variable called x our independent variable
  vector[N] x;
}

// This is the parameters block. 
// Here we define the free parameters which are the onces that STAN estimates for us.
// this is again a,b and sigma
parameters {
  real mu_a;
  real sigma_a;
  
  vector[S] a_dif;
  
  real mu_b;
  real sigma_b;
  
  vector[S] b_dif;
  
  real mu_sigma;
  real sigma_sigma;  
  
  vector[S] sigma_dif;
  
}

// This is the model block here we define the model.

transformed parameters{
  
  vector[S] a = mu_a+a_dif*exp(sigma_a);
  vector[S] b = mu_b+b_dif*exp(sigma_b);
  vector[S] sigma = mu_sigma+sigma_dif*exp(sigma_sigma);

}

model {

  
  //priors
  mu_a ~ normal(0,10);
  sigma_a ~ normal(0,5);
  a_dif ~ std_normal();
  
  
  mu_b ~ normal(0,10);
  sigma_b ~ normal(0,5);

  b_dif ~ std_normal();
  
  
  mu_sigma ~ normal(0,3);
  sigma_sigma ~ normal(0,3);
  
  sigma_dif ~ std_normal();

  
  
  
  for(n in 1:N){
    
    y[n] ~ normal(a[S_id[n]]+b[S_id[n]]*x[n], exp(sigma[S_id[n]]));

  }  
}
```

everything looks much better! Not perfect, but better and no
divergences. Also Note that now the sampler as also moved all the way
down into -12 in the sigma_sigma parameter, where before it only got to
around ~ -5

Lets plot the group level predictions of this model.

Here we plot some of the draws as in the other markdowns:

``` r
group_draws = as_draws_df(fit$draws(c("mu_a","sigma_a",
                                      "mu_b","sigma_b",

#get 200 random ids for the draws we select to plot.
draw_id = sample(1:4000,200)


params = group_draws %>% select(-contains(".")) %>%

df %>% mutate(draw = NA) %>%

Not to bad either!

## Final remarks

The main take aways are that hierarchical models are designed to fit
subjects together in the same model, such that we leverage all the
information and propergate all the uncertainty from subjects to get
group level estimates. These types of models have become corner stones
in the cognitive science literature, unfortunately they can be hard to
estimate. The difficulty of estimation in the Bayesian framework is
usually something that we can combat with clever use of priors and
parameterizations (as shown here). Unfortunatly in the frequentists
framework these models are sometimes impossible to fit due to bad
convergences and one has to “strip down the random effects”. This
pratice is essentially the same as saying that all subjects need to have
the same group level slope above. This can lead to inflated type 1 error
rates (ref?) and is generally not something I see positively.
