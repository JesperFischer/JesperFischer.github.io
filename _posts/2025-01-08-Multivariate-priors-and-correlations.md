## Overview

When doing hierarchical modeling, we usually model subjects nested
within a population. This entails estimating the parameters of our model
for each individual in our data-set, but also a group level parameter.
This approach to modeling the nested structure of our data have some
nice properties such as partial pooling (Need to find a nice reference
here). This aspect of hierarchical modeling essentially pools the
individual subject estimates towards the group mean, because they are
assumed to be drawn from this group mean distribution.

Another thing that is less commonly taught or talked about is that in
hierarchical modeling is the correlation between the subject level
parameters.

## Correlation coefficients.

There exists many correlation coefficients including pearsons, spearman
and kendells tau. In this section we are only interested in Pearsons
correlation coefficients as it is what naturally comes out of a
multivariate normal distribution (which is the multiivariate
distribution I will be using).

Before diving into multivariate distribution we look at the standard
formula for the Pearsons correlation coefficient.

![\rho = \frac{\sum\_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum\_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2} \sqrt{\sum\_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^2}}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Crho%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D%20%28x_i%20-%20%5Cbar%7Bx%7D%29%28y_i%20-%20%5Cbar%7By%7D%29%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D%20%28x_i%20-%20%5Cbar%7Bx%7D%29%5E2%7D%20%5Csqrt%7B%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D%20%28y_i%20-%20%5Cbar%7By%7D%29%5E2%7D%7D "\rho = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2} \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^2}}")

where
![\bar{x}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbar%7Bx%7D "\bar{x}")
and
![\bar{y}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbar%7By%7D "\bar{y}")
are the mean of the first and second variable respectively.

This can also be writing as covariance and variance in the following
way, which will be helpful in a bit:

![\rho\_{XY} = \frac{\operatorname{Cov}(X, Y)}{\sqrt{\operatorname{Var}(X) \cdot \operatorname{Var}(Y)}} \tag{1}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Crho_%7BXY%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Coperatorname%7BCov%7D%28X%2C%20Y%29%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B%5Coperatorname%7BVar%7D%28X%29%20%5Ccdot%20%5Coperatorname%7BVar%7D%28Y%29%7D%7D%20%5Ctag%7B1%7D "\rho_{XY} = \frac{\operatorname{Cov}(X, Y)}{\sqrt{\operatorname{Var}(X) \cdot \operatorname{Var}(Y)}} \tag{1}")

This is interesting as all of these entities are things that come out of
a multivariate normal distribution, in the variance co-variance matrix
(the last part below).

![\begin{pmatrix} X \\ Y \end{pmatrix} \sim \mathcal{N} \left( \begin{pmatrix} \mu_X \\ \mu_Y \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} \operatorname{Var}(X) & \operatorname{Cov}(X, Y) \\ \operatorname{Cov}(Y, X) & \operatorname{Var}(Y) \end{pmatrix} \right)](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cbegin%7Bpmatrix%7D%20X%20%5C%5C%20Y%20%5Cend%7Bpmatrix%7D%20%5Csim%20%5Cmathcal%7BN%7D%20%5Cleft%28%20%5Cbegin%7Bpmatrix%7D%20%5Cmu_X%20%5C%5C%20%5Cmu_Y%20%5Cend%7Bpmatrix%7D%2C%20%5Cbegin%7Bpmatrix%7D%20%5Coperatorname%7BVar%7D%28X%29%20%26%20%5Coperatorname%7BCov%7D%28X%2C%20Y%29%20%5C%5C%20%5Coperatorname%7BCov%7D%28Y%2C%20X%29%20%26%20%5Coperatorname%7BVar%7D%28Y%29%20%5Cend%7Bpmatrix%7D%20%5Cright%29 "\begin{pmatrix} X \\ Y \end{pmatrix} \sim \mathcal{N} \left( \begin{pmatrix} \mu_X \\ \mu_Y \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} \operatorname{Var}(X) & \operatorname{Cov}(X, Y) \\ \operatorname{Cov}(Y, X) & \operatorname{Var}(Y) \end{pmatrix} \right)")

The way to understand this formula is that X and Y are the random
variables (just as for the uni-variate case: e.g
![X \sim \mathcal{N} (\mu_X, \sigma_X)](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?X%20%5Csim%20%5Cmathcal%7BN%7D%20%28%5Cmu_X%2C%20%5Csigma_X%29 "X \sim \mathcal{N} (\mu_X, \sigma_X)")).
The first vector inside the normal distribution is the two means of the
random variables
![\mu_X](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_X "\mu_X") and
![\mu_Y](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cmu_Y "\mu_Y"). The last
part is the variance co-variance matrix which contains the variances of
the random variables (squared standard deviatations from the uni-variate
case
e.g.Â (![\sigma_X^2 = Var(X)](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csigma_X%5E2%20%3D%20Var%28X%29 "\sigma_X^2 = Var(X)"))),
but also the covariance between the random variables Cov(X,Y). These
co-variances contains the information we need to compute the correlation
coefficient together with the variances (eq. 1)

Lets demonstrate this by simulating some data

## Simulations.

Below I will simulate from a multivariate normal with means of 0 and
variances (and also standard deviations) 1.

This means that the off-diagonal (the Cov(X,Y) and Cov(Y,X)) of the
variance-covariance matrix is the correlation coefficient (see this by
setting the numerator to 1 in (1)). Thus here the correlation
coefficient (and the covariance) is 0.5.

``` r
#data points
n <- 100
#variance co-variance matrix 
R <- matrix(c(1, 0.5,
              0.5, 1), 
            nrow = 2, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
#means
mu <- c(X = 0, Y = 0)
#random variables from the multivariate normal
data = data.frame(mvtnorm::rmvnorm(n, mean = mu, sigma = R))
```

plotting it!

``` r
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = X, y = Y))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_minimal()
```

We see that there is a correlation which is around 0.5.

## Hierarchical modeling.

There might be a couple of reasons to use multivariate distributions
when doing hierarchical modeling. The first is that instead of assuming
that all your parameters are independent, one lets the model estimate
the correlation between them. This from practical experience gives close
to the same estimates as just fitting these parameters independently and
afterwards correlating them, thus this first aspect is just for
convenience (not having to calculate the correlation coefficients
afterwards).

The second reason for including multivariate distributions when doing
hierarchical modeling has to do with generating data that would be
expected from an experiment.

many times when simulating data from a hierarchical model we end up in a
situations where we cannot achieve the behavior we expect from our real
subjects. This is especially the case with more and more complex models
(models with many parameters). The reason (sometimes) for this is that
without dependency / correlations between the parameters the model will
many times produce impossible or unreasonable data. Thus in order to
simulate data that resemble what we expect we need to understand these
correlations. In the following we will be doing this with a multivariate
normal distribution, which means we need to assume that our priors for
our parameters are all multi-variate normally distributed (another
reason to have parameters be normally distributed and then transformed
instead of coming from another distribtuion).

## Hierarchical modeling with correlations!

Now we take the knowledge of simulations of multivariate normal
distributions from above and apply it in the example used in the
hierarchical modeling.

What needs to be stressed is that our individual data-points are going
to be extracted exactly the same the only thing that changes is how we
get the subject level parameters. We start with the simulation from
before:

``` r
#number of simulated subjects
n_sub = 50
#number of simulated trials
n_trials = 100

#intercepts:
int = rnorm(n_sub,0,50)
#slopes:
slopes = rnorm(n_sub,3,3)
#sigma
sigma = 50

#x values
xs = seq(0,50,length.out = n_trials)

# simulate trialwise responses:
df_uncor = data.frame(intercept = int, slopes = slopes,sigma = sigma) %>% 
  mutate(id = 1:n_sub,
         x = list(seq(0,50,length.out = n_trials))) %>% 
  unnest(x) %>% rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(y_mean = intercept + x * slopes,
         y_pred = rnorm(1,intercept + x * slopes, sigma))
```

Here we simulate 50 subjects of 100 trials each. Each subjects gets an
intercept from the group level distribution of
![\sim \mathcal{N(0,50)}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csim%20%5Cmathcal%7BN%280%2C50%29%7D "\sim \mathcal{N(0,50)}")
and a slope estimate from the same group level distribution of
![\sim \mathcal{N}(3,3)](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Csim%20%5Cmathcal%7BN%7D%283%2C3%29 "\sim \mathcal{N}(3,3)").

Here we essentially fix group mean of the intercept to 0, and the
between subject variance of the intercept to 50, whereas the group mean
slope is 3 and the between subject variance of the slope to 3, and
importantly with no correlation between the intercept and slope.

Now below we use the same values for means and standard deviations, but
we sample the intercept and slope from the same multivariate normal
distribution with a correlation of -0.8.

This correlation entails back-calculating the covariance from (1). which
entails:

![\rho\_{XY} \cdot {\sqrt{\operatorname{Var}(X) \cdot \operatorname{Var}(Y)}} = \operatorname{Cov}(X, Y) \tag{2}](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Crho_%7BXY%7D%20%5Ccdot%20%7B%5Csqrt%7B%5Coperatorname%7BVar%7D%28X%29%20%5Ccdot%20%5Coperatorname%7BVar%7D%28Y%29%7D%7D%20%3D%20%5Coperatorname%7BCov%7D%28X%2C%20Y%29%20%5Ctag%7B2%7D "\rho_{XY} \cdot {\sqrt{\operatorname{Var}(X) \cdot \operatorname{Var}(Y)}} = \operatorname{Cov}(X, Y) \tag{2}")

Simulating the data:

``` r
#number of simulated subjects
n_sub = 50
#number of simulated trials
n_trials = 100

mu_slope = 3
sd_slope = 3

mu_int = 0
sd_int= 50

correlation = -0.8

cov = correlation * sqrt(sd_slope^2 * sd_int ^2)

#variance co-variance matrix 
R <- matrix(c(sd_int^2, cov,
              cov, sd_slope^2), 
            nrow = 2, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
#means
mu <- c(X = mu_int, Y = mu_slope)
#random variables from the multivariate normal
data = data.frame(mvtnorm::rmvnorm(n_sub, mean = mu, sigma = R)) %>% 
  rename(intercept = X, slopes = Y)


#sigma
sigma = 50

#x values
xs = seq(0,50,length.out = n_trials)

# simulate trialwise responses:
df_cor = data %>% mutate(sigma = sigma) %>% 
  mutate(id = 1:n_sub,
         x = list(seq(0,50,length.out = n_trials))) %>% 
  unnest(x) %>% rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(y_mean = intercept + x * slopes,
         y_pred = rnorm(1,intercept + x * slopes, sigma))
```

Lets plot the two to see the difference!

First on the parameters.

``` r
rbind(df_cor %>% mutate(correlation = T),df_uncor %>% 
        mutate(correlation = F)) %>% 
  dplyr::select(intercept, slopes,correlation) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = intercept, y = slopes, col = correlation))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(legend.position = "top")+
  facet_wrap(~correlation)
```

![](../images/Bayesian-Workflow-Tutorials/2025-01-08-Multivariate-priors-and-correlations_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

And then the regression lines!

``` r
rbind(df_cor %>% mutate(correlation = T),
      df_uncor %>% mutate(correlation = F)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y_mean,group = interaction(id,correlation), col = correlation))+
  geom_line()+
  theme_minimal()+facet_wrap(~correlation)
```

![](../images/Bayesian-Workflow-Tutorials/2025-01-08-Multivariate-priors-and-correlations_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

From these plots we see that the high negative correlation constrains
the possible simulated values, such that the predicted mean responses
are less spread out. This is because as the intercept becomes more
positive the slopes have to becomes more negative and vise versa.

We can fit this using the same hierarchical model from before:

``` stan
//This block defines the input that. So these things needs to go into the model
data {
  
  //Define the number of datapoints this is defined by an integer
  int N;
  
  //Define the number of subjects this is defined by an integer
  int S;
  
  //identifier for which subject this trial belongs to
  array[N] int  S_id;
  
  //Define a vector called y that is as long as the number of datapoints (i.e. N)
  vector[N] y;
  // same as y but a variable called x our independent variable
  vector[N] x;
}

// This is the parameters block. 
// Here we define the free parameters which are the onces that STAN estimates for us.
// this is again a,b and sigma
parameters {
  real mu_a;
  real sigma_a;
  
  vector[S] a_dif;
  
  real mu_b;
  real sigma_b;
  
  vector[S] b_dif;
  
  real mu_sigma;
  real sigma_sigma;  
  
  vector[S] sigma_dif;
  
}

// This is the model block here we the model.

transformed parameters{
  
  vector[S] a = mu_a+a_dif*exp(sigma_a);
  vector[S] b = mu_b+b_dif*exp(sigma_b);
  vector[S] sigma = mu_sigma+sigma_dif*exp(sigma_sigma);

}

model {

  //priors
  mu_a ~ normal(0,10);
  sigma_a ~ normal(0,5);
  a_dif ~ std_normal();
  
  
  mu_b ~ normal(0,10);
  sigma_b ~ normal(0,5);

  b_dif ~ std_normal();
  
  
  mu_sigma ~ normal(0,3);
  sigma_sigma ~ normal(0,3);
  
  sigma_dif ~ std_normal();
  
  for(n in 1:N){
    
    y[n] ~ normal(a[S_id[n]]+b[S_id[n]]*x[n], exp(sigma[S_id[n]]));

  }  
}
```

Also looks good! Lets calculate the correlation that stan find between
the slope and the intercept!

To do this we get two data-frames one with the draws from the intercept
for all subjects and one for the slopes:

``` r
subject_draws = as_draws_df(fit$draws(c("mu_b","sigma_b","b_dif"))) %>% 
  dplyr::select(-contains("."))
```

    ## Warning: Dropping 'draws_df' class as required metadata was removed.

    cols = matches("^(a|b|sigma)_dif"),
    names_to = c("parameter", "id"),
    names_pattern = "(.*)_(dif\\[\\d+\\])"
  ) %>%
  mutate(id = str_extract(id, "\\d+")) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "parameter", values_from = value) %>% 
  mutate(b = mu_b + b * sigma_b) %>% dplyr::select(id,b) %>%

Then we make an empty vector where we store all the correlation
coefficients when we loop through the draws: (this is very inefficient
but works for now).

``` r
correlation_coef = c()
for(i in 1:2000){
  correlation_coef[i] = cor.test(as.numeric(slope_draws[i,]),
                                 as.numeric(int_draws[i,]))$estimate[[1]]
}
```

now we can plot the distribution of correlation coefficients:

``` r
data.frame() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = correlation_coef))+
  geom_histogram(col = "black")+
  theme_minimal()+
  xlab("Correlation coefficient")
```

    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

Now one might say âBut hey we put in -0.8 didnât we?â. This would be
correct, however there is some uncertainty in this, so we can go back to
the data and see what the correlation between the slope and intercept
actually was:

``` r
parameters = df_cor %>% dplyr::select(intercept, slopes) %>% 
  distinct()

cor.test(parameters$intercept,parameters$slopes)
```

    ## 
    ##  Pearson's product-moment correlation
    ## 
    ## data:  parameters$intercept and parameters$slopes
    ## t = -14.87, df = 48, p-value < 2.2e-16
    ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0
    ## 95 percent confidence interval:
    ##  -0.9460860 -0.8400408
    ## sample estimates:
    ##        cor 
    ## -0.9064413

-0.90 which is very close to what Stan gives out!

## Multivariate distributions inside stan.

Now we have simulated data where the parameters had a correlation of
~0.8 and then fitted a Stan model without specifying the correlation
coefficient, but still being able to estimate it. Thus one might ask
whether it even makes sense to code the Stan model with the correlation
coefficient.

I have no good reasons other than it being convenient to why one wants
to calculate the correlation within Stan using multivariate normal
distribution priors on the parameters. One small reason is that its
possible (and necessary) to put a prior on the correlation coefficient.
Below is how to do this inside Stan! Note; there are a couple of things
different from the other Stan formulation! Some for ease and others that
are crucial for the variance co-variance matrix.

Lets look at the differences between the two implementations:

- group means and between subject variances (mu\_\* and sigma\_\*) are
  now stored in vectors called mus and sigmas respectively.

- The subject level differences (the standard normal distribution for
  the non-centered parameterization) are now stored in a matrix of
  \[N_params , subjects\].

- In the parameters block, another variable âL_uâ is defined as a
  cholesky_factor_corr\[3\]. This thing is essentially what helps define
  the covariance (and therefore also the correlation) between the
  variables. This is a reparameterization (just as the non-centered
  parameterization) to help the sampler not run into sampling issues.
  For the example of not reparameterizing such a multivariate model (and
  therefore modeling the variance -covariance matrix directly) see [the
  fantastic explanation on
  11.1.3](https://bruno.nicenboim.me/bayescogsci/ch-complexstan.html#sec-corrstan).

- The start of the model block includes a new âtransformed_difsâ
  parameter that contains the subject level differences from the group
  means in a matrix with columns being the parameters (1 through 3) and
  the subjects being the rows. Is thus makes sense that each individual
  subject level parameter is defined afterwards as the group mean plus
  this difference.

- Because we defined the new âL_uâ parameter that contains the
  information about the correlation between our subject level
  parameters, we also need to add a prior on it. This is what the line
  âL_u ~ lkj_corr_cholesky(2);â does. To get a sense of what this
  distribtuion entails for the prior on the correlation coefficient, see
  the end of this markdown. Here it suffices to say that the 2 is a wide
  but not uniform distribution on the correlation coefficient within the
  constrained range of correlation coefficients \[-1 ; 1\].

- Lastly, we use the last type of âblockâ in Stan, the generated
  quantities block. This block is outside of optimization, so all that
  happens here is based on the results of the fitted model and could in
  principle be done outside of Stan. In the generated quantities block
  we calculate the correlation matrix for convenience, which means that
  one can get the correlation matrix out using
  fit\$summary(correlation_matrix), instead of doing the operation after
  model fitting.

``` stan
//This block defines the input that. So these things needs to go into the model
data {
  
  //Define the number of datapoints this is defined by an integer
  int N;
  
  //Define the number of subjects this is defined by an integer
  int S;
  
  //identifier for which subject this trial belongs to
  array[N] int  S_id;
  
  //Define a vector called y that is as long as the number of datapoints (i.e. N)
  vector[N] y;
  // same as y but a variable called x our independent variable
  vector[N] x;
}

// This is the parameters block. 
// Here we define the free parameters which are the onces that STAN estimates for us.
// this is again a,b and sigma
parameters {

  vector[3] mus;
  
  vector<lower=0>[3] sigmas;
  matrix[3,S] difs;
  cholesky_factor_corr[3] L_u;    // Between participant cholesky decomposition

}

// This is the model block here we define the model

model {
  matrix[S, 3] transformed_difs = (diag_pre_multiply(sigmas, L_u) * difs)'; // transformed deviations
  vector[S] a = mus[1] + (transformed_difs[,1]); // intercept per subject
  vector[S] b = mus[2] + (transformed_difs[,2]); // slope per subject
  vector[S] sigma = mus[3] + (transformed_difs[,3]); // standard deviation per subject

  
  //priors
  mus[1] ~ normal(0,10);
  sigmas[1] ~ normal(50,20);
  
  mus[2] ~ normal(0,10);
  sigmas[2] ~ normal(2,2);

  mus[3] ~ normal(0,3);
  sigmas[3] ~ normal(0,3);
  
  to_vector(difs) ~ std_normal();

  L_u ~ lkj_corr_cholesky(2);
  
  for(n in 1:N){
    
    y[n] ~ normal(a[S_id[n]]+b[S_id[n]]*x[n], exp(sigma[S_id[n]]));

  }  
}

generated quantities{
  matrix[3,3] correlation_matrix = L_u * L_u';
}
```

Lets try and fit it!

Here the correlation that we care about (the one we put in) is the one
with rows and columns of \[2,1\] or \[1,2\] (as its symmetrical).

Which is again basically what the simulation showed of -0.9

## The LKJ distribution.

Below i plot a couple of values of the LKJ distribution for 3
parameters. The random number generator for this distribution can be
found in the ggdist package.

Note; the function takes 3 arguments. Number of samples, number of
parameters and the eta-value which i show below is the precision around
0. Higher values of eta is equal to less probability in the extreme
correlations.

``` r
etas = c(1,2,5,10,20,100)

df = data.frame()
for(eta in etas){
  draws = ggdist::rlkjcorr_marginal(1000,3,eta)
  dq = data.frame(draws = draws, eta = eta)
  df = rbind(df,dq)
}

df %>% mutate(eta = as.factor(eta)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = draws, fill = eta))+
  geom_histogram(col = "black", position = "identity")+
  theme_minimal()+
  facet_wrap(~eta, labeller = label_both)+
  xlab("Correlation coefficient")
```

    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

## Final remarks

In this markdown we have look at multivariate prior distributions for
our hierarchical models and the subject level parameters in these. It
should be clear from the markdown that incorporating the multivariate
priors is not necessary for correct inference on the parameters and
their correlations, but just a convenience! The main part to take away
from this markdown is the simulations of correlated parameters. This
will become quite important when wanting to simulate data that could
come from an experimental paradigm. If non-correlated parameters
(independent priors) are simulated the response profiles will be very
wide and thus unreasonable. For additional context watch this [Youtube
video of Paul
BÃ¼rkner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbgAMkN18dA&t=2344s).
